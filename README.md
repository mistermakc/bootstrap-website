# Javascript project

This repository contains the code for the javascript project. The project's objective is to establish a webshop 
with a product view, filtering, and shopping cart functionality. This includes querying the product portfolio 
through a pre-defined json and deploying the webshop via GitHub Pages. 

Try it out: [IE Golf Club Webshop](https://mistermakc.github.io)

This could be the webshop for the following products:

3. Shopping cart (shopping-cart.html)
